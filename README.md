# qmonorepo
This is the main repository for our app, it contains dedicated directories for FE / BE / Admin which can be easily split afterwards to dedicated repositories


## Some basic rules which we will be using

Branching for the features goes from the dev fork.
Branch name **TICKET-ID-feature-description** --> where **feature-description** is minimum 1 word and maximum 4 words. Aim to give meaningfull names to your brunches. 

For commit messages allways aim to use messaging aligned with https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/

NEVER commit directly to dev or main branch! All your commits go to relevant branch, and when your work is ready create Pull Request (PR) to dev branch.
Once wehen we are coordinated and happy with dev state, dev gets merged to main, and main gets merged back to dev.

When you create PR on github review it buy your self, in case that you think it's smart that your teammate does review as well let him know directly.
Aim to review open PR's daily, and to merge them daily as well.

## Important

Maintain this document so that it is summarizing the state of the app.
